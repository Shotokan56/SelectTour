    <h4>Indochina</h4>
    <div class="">
        Many centuries ago, the Khmer Empire became the most important realm in Cambodia. The legacy of this great civilization remains today with a vast collection of temples at the empire’s capital, Angkor, north of Cambodia’s current capital, Phnom Penh. Angkor complex is now the most famous touristic area in Cambodia and that is a "must - see" place of visitors<br>
        Cambodia has a tropical climate with generally warm weather year round. In the coolest months in October and December, the average temperature is not lower than 25 degrees. Luang Prabang in Laos is a bit cooler than Cambodia with the average temperature is around 3 - 5 degrees lower<br>
        The Cambodians celebrate their history during the Angkor Festival held from November to December with poetry, music and dance. The water festival features boat racing on the Mekong River and Tonle Sap in Phnom Penh. In January the Laotians celebrate Khoun Khao to honour the harvest.
