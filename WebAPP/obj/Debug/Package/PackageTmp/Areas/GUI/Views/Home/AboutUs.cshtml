<h3>About us</h3>

<p>
    “When I was a child, I had a great dream is to explore the new lands. I had seated for hours

    in front of the TV to watch the Travel programs and always wished I could go there.
</p>

<p>
    That dream came true after I had educated from a faculty of Tourism of a university in

    Hanoi. With the depth training, I love more and more travelling and started my journeys. I

    had worked for some Travel Agents and Tour Operators in Hanoi and had more chances to go

    and visit most of the famous and beautiful places in Vietnam as well as in Indochina. After

    10 years working in tourism and hospitality industry with much experience in independent

    travelers, small groups to the big groups, M.I.C.E and leisure groups, I decided to start my

    own business. VietSelectTours has been established and that is my love in travelling I would

    share to all of you, my dear friends.”

<h4>
    VIETNAM AND INDOCHINA
</h4>

<p>
    Indochina is a general name called three countries which was under the colonial of French,

    includes Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Although each country has the difference in culture,

    landscape, people, but the same history in a short period creates a close relationship

    between these countries. It’s easy to travel between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia by short

    flights.
</p>

  <h4>
    Vietnam
</h4>

   <p>
    Vietnam is a small country in Southeast Asia but it’s a country of world heritages with 2

    natural heritage sites, 5 cultural Heritage sites, 1 mixed heritage site and 9 intangible

    cultural heritage forms. Come to see Vietnam, you can find a fascinating blend of diverging

    genealogy; something that is noticeably reflected in its culture, food, architecture and

    religion. Undeniably, much of the interest in Vietnam comes from its history, generating a

    sense of alluring mystery and curiosity.
</p>

  <p>
    You’ll soon find however that its popularity as a holiday destination is attributed to its quaint

    villages, lush green landscapes, and what can seem like a never ending stretch of beautiful

    winding coastline. There are many beautiful and amazing landscapes, friendly locals,

    authentic culture here and it’s so easy to choose one of suitable travel styles or mix some of

    them to be your trip: Visit scenic mountain peak, sprawling rice fields and quiet villages for a

    truly authentic Vietnam experience; or you can explore the natural Vietnamese landscape in

    the rainforests and taste Vietnamese cuisine with regional specialties and national dishes

    offering a deliciously fresh insight into the daily life of Southeast Asia.
</p>

 <p>
    All above make Vietnam is one of Asia’s most popular tourist destinations.
</p>

<h4> Cambodia and Laos</h4>

<p>
    Many centuries ago, the Khmer Empire became the most important realm in Cambodia. The

    legacy of this great civilization remains today with a vast collection of temples at the

    empire’s capital, Angkor, north of Cambodia’s current capital, Phnom Penh. Angkor complex

    is now the most famous touristic area in Cambodia and that is a "must - see" place of visitors
</p>

 <p>
    Cambodia has a tropical climate with generally warm weather year round. In the coolest

    months in October and December, the average temperature is not lower than 25 degrees.

    Luang Prabang in Laos is a bit cooler than Cambodia with the average temperature is around 3

    - 5 degrees lower
</p>
<p>
    The Cambodians celebrate their history during the Angkor Festival held from November to

    December with poetry, music and dance. The water festival features boat racing on the

    Mekong River and Tonle Sap in Phnom Penh. In January the Laotians celebrate Khoun Khao to

    honour the harvest.
